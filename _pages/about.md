I’m a tech-driven builder creating human-first experiences at the intersection of AI, product design, and purpose. I’ve led and built systems for startups, local businesses, and my own creative ventures.

I'm advancing my Bachelor of Engineering at ATME College, specializing in AI and machine learning, set to culminate in December 2026. My academic pursuits are complemented by hands-on leadership roles and a commitment to practical applications of learning, as evidenced by directing projects within the IEEE student branch and earning multiple certifications in high-demand tech areas.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
