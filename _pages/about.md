# Building Tomorrow's Technology Today

> "The best way to predict the future is to create it." â€” *Alan Kay*

## The Blueprint

I'm **Sanjan B M** â€” a technology architect crafting at the intersection of artificial intelligence and human-centered design. As Vice Chair of the **IEEE ATME Student Branch**, I'm not just studying the tech landscape; I'm actively reshaping it through leadership, innovation, and collaborative problem-solving.

My journey marries rigorous academic pursuit with hands-on creation, resulting in a portfolio that spans multiple domains while maintaining a singular focus: leveraging technology to enhance human experience.

## Technical Foundation

```python
skills = {
    "languages": ["Python", "JavaScript", "HTML/CSS"],
    "frameworks": ["React", "Node.js", "Express", "Next.js"],
    "databases": ["MongoDB", "MySQL"],
    "tools": ["Git", "Power BI"],
    "deployment": ["Vercel", "Render"],
    "concepts": ["Machine Learning", "Web Development", "API Integration"]
}
```

## Academic Architecture

**Bachelor of Technology | AI & Machine Learning**  
ATME College of Engineering, Mysuru  
*CGPA: 9.19/10 | Expected Graduation: 2026*

My academic journey is more than courseworkâ€”it's a deliberate progression through the foundations of artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, and their practical applications in solving complex problems.

## Experience Ecosystem

### ðŸš€ Engineering the Future

As a **freelance web developer**, I've translated client visions into responsive MERN stack applications that prioritize user experience while maintaining technical excellence. Each project is an opportunity to merge design thinking with development precision.

My **AI internship at COSMIC365.AI** allowed me to dive deeper into machine learning model development, where I helped transform raw data into actionable intelligence through careful preprocessing and thoughtful model architecture.

### ðŸ’¡ Leading by Design

Leadership isn't just a titleâ€”it's a responsibility I embrace as **Vice Chair of IEEE ATMECE**. By organizing technical workshops, facilitating industry connections, and mentoring emerging talent, I've helped cultivate a community where innovation thrives.

As **Project Manager** for various technical initiatives, I've learned that successful delivery isn't just about codeâ€”it's about orchestrating diverse talents toward a unified vision.

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Fashion Item Generator</h3>
    <p>Harnessing the power of GANs to revolutionize fashion design through AI-driven creativity</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="project">
    <h3>Full-Stack Cafe Solution</h3>
    <p>Seamless MERN stack implementation bringing cafes into the digital age with intuitive ordering</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="project">
    <h3>GSI Management Dashboard</h3>
    <p>React-powered admin interface providing comprehensive e-commerce management capabilities</p>
  </div>
</div>

*Each project represents not just technical implementation, but a problem solved and value delivered.*

## Open Source & Community

I believe in the power of collaborative innovation. Through contributions to **GirlScript Winter of Contributing** and **Social Winter of Code**, I've added my voice to the global conversation about technology's role in creating positive change.

As an active participant in the IEEE community, I work to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applicationâ€”creating spaces where ideas can flourish and transform into impactful solutions.

---

## The Vision Forward

I'm driven by the potential of technology to solve meaningful problems. My focus remains on:

- Creating AI solutions that augment human capability rather than replacing it
- Developing web experiences that delight users while solving real needs
- Contributing to communities that foster inclusive innovation
- Building technologies that stand at the intersection of efficiency and empathy
